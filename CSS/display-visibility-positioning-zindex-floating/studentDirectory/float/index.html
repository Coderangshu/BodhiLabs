    <div class="profile-left">Stray Dog: Raju</div>
    <p>
        Meet Raju, a 7-year-old stray dog who spends his days outside the local bakery.
        Though he has no permanent home, Raju is well-known in the neighborhood for his loyalty and playful nature.
        Children often stop by to feed him biscuits, and he greets them with a wagging tail.
    </p>

    <div class="profile-right">Pet Dog: Bruno</div>
    <p>
        Bruno, on the other hand, lives comfortably in an apartment just across the street.
        While he enjoys daily walks and regular meals, his favorite part of the day is meeting Raju.

        This paragraph appears below the floated elements. Despite their contrasting lives,
        Bruno and Raju's bond shows that companionship doesn’t depend on background—it grows from kindness and plain puppy love.
