    <h1>Exploring Display and Visibility</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>This is inline display</h2>
        <p>
            Some words are <em class="box inline-example">inline</em> and flow naturally with the text.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>This is inline-block display</h2>
        <p>
            Inline-block allows <strong class="box inline-block-example">this box</strong> to have width and height but still flow inline.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>This is block display</h2>
        <p>
            This sentence is followed by a <span class="box block-example">block box</span> which forces a line break and takes up full width.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>This is hidden visibility</h2>
        <p>
            This line contains a <span class="box hidden-example">hidden box</span> that is invisible but still holds space.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>This is none display</h2>
        <p>
            Here we have a <span class="box none-example">removed box</span> that doesn’t appear and doesn’t occupy any space.
        </p>
    </section>
