    <h2>List with Inside Position</h2>
    <ul id="ul-inside-position">
        <li>This is a long list item that should wrap and keep bullet inside the text block.

The text should wrap in the screen depending on the pixels in the screen the number of characters that can be accomodated in a single line varies, so to make sure the text wraps to the next line this line is made a long one.</li>
